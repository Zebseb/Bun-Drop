Bun Drop

###

A React (and JavaScript) application used by anyone to browse between burgers, fries, shakes etc. and order them to any address of choice. The main concept is that the orders are delivered by a drone, hence the project name.

By going to the cart page you can always check what you currently have in your product-list.

When checking out the user will be able to choose between debit card and Swish as payment options.

There is a possibility to sign up and log in to the app. By doing this the user will also have access to its order history on the profile page and adding favourites on the menu page.
